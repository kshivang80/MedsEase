                    With the ongoing pandemic, online doctor consultation is the
                    need of the hour. I've enjoyed the benefit of FREE doctor
                    consultations with my Plus membership. I've made extra
                    savings on all my medicine orders & lab test bookings too.”

                    I must admit that I've made huge savings since I became a
                    member of Pharmeasy Plus. There's not just free deliveries
                    but extra cashback on every order too! It makes ordering
                    monthly medicines a truly satisfying experience.”

                    I feel like a premium customer as a PharmEasy plus member.
                    All the extra discounts, free deliveries, it can't get any
                    better than this! Also, since lockdown, I didn't have to
                    step out for my medical and healthcare needs anymore.”
